Add rewards to GitHub Issues

<br>

## What is the projects app?

Projects can be added by connecting a Github repo, which will then display the repo's issues within Aragon. Members of the organizations will be able to curate issues to prioritize a roadmap or collectively allocate bounties to multiple issues in a single action.
