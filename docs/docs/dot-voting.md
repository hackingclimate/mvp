Dot voting allows you to split up your votes just like you split up a pie.

## What is dot voting?

[Dot voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting) is when voters can split thier vote into multiple pieces, then vote for multiple things. Imagine you have a pie. The pie is your vote. You can cut the pie up into different sized pieces and give them to the vandidates you support. This means that instead you giving a candidate all or none of the pie, you can support different votes with different levels of enthusiasm. This is useful to increase participation so people don't feel locked into any option they don't fully agree with.

## What is dot voting good for?

Dot voting is also good as a signalling mechanism to better understand how people feel about multiple options. For example a group wants to choose ice cream for a party. Perhaps you're fine with either chocolate or mint, but not at all vanilla. You could then vote 50% chocolate and 50% mint, but not vanilla. This way the vote more accurately gathers signals from the group as to what they all want.

Dot Voting is often used to for issue curation. Members can vote on how to distribute an allocation across distinct entities, for example prioritizing a list of Github issues by specifying a percentage of votes per option.

Notice the "Dot Voting" app on the left side vertical menu bar? That's the Autark dot voting app. Once you have it installed you can create dot votes that will allow voters to click on votes in the middle of the page and then use the slider bars to determine how much of their voting weight they want to use for each vote.

## Where can I learn more?

The [Aurark website](https://www.autark.xyz/) is a great start.
- [Range Voting app](https://www.autark.xyz/range-voting) (note: range voting = dot voting)

[This blog post](https://medium.com/@stellarmagnet/that-planning-suite-live-on-rinkeby-c2332e2e5e27) also explains how to use the app in more detail.
