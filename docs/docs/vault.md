Securely owns and manages tokens on behalf of a DAO.

## What is the vault app?

The vault holds all of the DAO's assets. While you might move some funds from the vault to other apps in the DAO, the majority will stay in the vault. This way, only with the DAOs explicit permission (often via a vote or multisig) can funds move out of the vault. This ensures that apps only have access to the funds that you give them, and even if an app has a bug, the majority of your funds are safe in the vault.
