This desscribes the 1Hive token model, community expectations, and governance structure. 

<br>

## Membership üêù

Established community members can request formal membership in the 1Hive organization that is currently [deployed on rinkeby](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211). Formal members are identified by a non-transferrable `Bee` token, which grants them various rights related to the governance of the 1Hive organization.

Members are expected to remain actively engaged and are **required** to participate in governance decisions. If a member becomes inactive, the remaining members should vote to remove them. Members are responsible for minting and budgeting `Honey`, a separate transferrable token issued by the organization.

`Honey` is used to coordinate contributions. Members can earn `Honey` by contributing to 1Hive *projects*, by being nominated for a *community allocation*, or by being added to *payroll*. `Honey` is used to govern the organizations treasury and is *redeemable* for a proportional share of treasury assets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The configuration of the organization is still being tested and many of the applications being utilized have not been audited or officially released. The organization will be migrated to mainnet when the process and applications are considered stable. Membership and balances of Honey will be moved to the new organization when this happens.

## Projects and Tasks ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The organization works on various projects. Each project is represented by a github repo and each project task is represented by a github issue. The **Projects** application is used to fund and manage a task's lifecycle.

To minimize the need to vote on every stage of the workflow, the funding of issues is delegated to *curators*, which help to create, refine, and prioritize tasks. Approving task assignment and work review is delegated to *reviewers*. You can think of the curator role as similar to that of a product manager, and a reviewer as a mentor. A `Honey`-based vote is required to add or remove someone from the *curator* or *reviewer* role.

### Expectations of Curators

Curators are responsible for refining tasks to ensure that they are well specified and can be scoped accurately. Once scoped they are responsible for funding high priority issues based on their estimate of the amount of time and level of experience required to complete a task. Throughout this process they are encouraged to solicit feedback from other members of the organization but decision and responsibility is ultimately theirs alone.

All tasks are funded with `Honey` and all projects share the same budget of `Honey`, which is periodically minted by vote of `Bee` token holders. This is done for the sake of flexibility and simplicity, but it is expected that the organization will coordinate offline to determine strategic budget allocations between projects and that curators will try to operate within a project's budget.

### Expectations of Reviewers

Reviewers are experienced members of the community responsible for approving task assignments and reviewing completed work. There is only one reviewer role for all types of projects, and any reviewer can approve and review work on any task. However, the expectation is that reviewers will coordinate with Workers and Curators to only approve and review work in their areas of expertise.

The reviewer should act as mentor both when choosing whether to approve a worker for a task and when reviewing completed work. If a worker is not a good fit for a task because of a perceived lack of experience, the reviewer may suggest a more appropriate task. If submitted work needs improvement, the reviewer should attempt to provide guidance.

### Expectations of Workers

Workers are expected to review tasks and ask clarifying questions about the requirements and scope prior to accepting to work on an issue.

Once accepted they should ask for help if they need it and they should keep track of the time they spend and report this time when submitting their work. While time tracking may seem tedious, it provides a critical feedback loop that allows curators and reviewers to more accurately scope and assign tasks, and accurately scoped and assigned tasks ensure that workers are fairly compensated for their effort.

## Community Allocation and Payroll üí∏

Many types of contributions do not fit well into a rigidly defined atomic task model. The efforts of Curators and Reviewers, the deployment and ongoing operational costs of maintaining infrastructure such as website or Ethereum node, or the ad-hoc nature of community and social engagement. These contributions are critical to the success of 1Hive and must also be rewarded. We use two different mechanism to compensate members for these types of contributions.

On a weekly basis, we use the **Allocations** application to distribute a fixed amount of `Honey` between a set of nominated recipients. The weekly allocations amount is determined by `Bee` vote, and then split between nominees using the **Dot Voting** application. Any member of the organization can nominate any other member for an allocation period simply by saying so in the keybase #nominations channel. An *Allocations Admin* is responsible for creating the weekly allocations vote and including all nominees each Monday.

Allocations are useful for rewarding ad-hoc contributions or exemplary behavior above and beyond normal expectations. However, there is an expectation of basic duties associated with certain roles including Curators, Reviewers, and members who maintain the organization's infrastructure. These behaviors are best compensated with recurring payments through the **Payroll** application.

### Expectations for Nomination
Members should nominate other members and provide an anecdote for why they are making the nomination. A nomination is like saying "thank you" for going above and beyond in some way. There is no minimum or maximum number of nominations you can make in a given week, but they should be sincere. It should feel good and somewhat unexpected to be nominated.

### Expectations for Payroll
 Payroll is intended to provide a baseline compensation level for consistent contributors. Payroll is in addition to any compensation earned through tasks or allocations, and therefore should not be compared to an equivalent salary. Members who are added to payroll should have a clearly defined scope of recurring work which is consistent with their payroll allotment. A member who has been added to Payroll can choose to claim their allotment in any treasury asset, including `Honey`.

## Long-term Rewards üçØ

1Hive may pursue projects which have the potential to generate future revenue. These revenue streams will be directed to the treasury. `Honey` can be redeemed for a proportional share of the current treasury assets, but if there is consensus among members treasury assets can also be distributed proportionally to `Honey` holders using the **Rewards** application. This encourages members to seek sustainable revenue streams and grow the project over a long time horizon.
