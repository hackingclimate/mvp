## What Is Aragon?

Aragon wants to empower people and create more freedom in the world. Most people like that idea, but Aragon is actually doing something about it. You can read all about it in [their manifesto](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-0.md). 

The [website](https://aragon.org/) is a great place to start to learn about all things Aragon. This [blog](https://blog.aragon.one/) is awesome too. There's also a [monthly newsletter](https://monthly.aragon.org/). 

There's excellent dev docs at [hack.aragon](https://hack.aragon.org/), but they are aimed at a more technical audience.

If you want to learn more about the architecture of Aragon in general, the [Wiki](https://wiki.aragon.org/) is probably the best (and the most boring) way to familiarize yourself with Aragon. There are also [user guides](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/), but I don't know of anyone who's actually used them.

## The Aragon Client

The client is the thing you use to interact with software. In this case that's the Aragon app itself. The UI is fairly standard, but takes a some getting used to at first. While you can go to https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/ to roll your own DAO, it's not very fun exploring a decentralized organization of 1. Luckily you don't have to! [1Hive has DAO that's live and running](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211). Feel free to click around and explore how the various apps correspond to the spec outline in the [handbook](https://1hive.github.io/mvp/docs/guides/1hive). Don't worry, unless you're a member of the hive that has voting power you can't break anything, so any button is fair game ðŸ˜Š

## [Aragon Apps](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#3-aragon-apps)

The Aragon Core team officially ships and maintains a few apps. It would be cool if someone explained them here or linked to something that did.
