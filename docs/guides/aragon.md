# WIP 🚧
Just posting stuff to start getting something on the blank page that can then be refined into something that's actually helpful :)

## What Is Aragon

Aragon wants to empower people and create more freedom in the world. Most people like that idea, but Aragon is actually doing something about it. You can read all about it in [their manifesto](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-0.md). 

The [website](https://aragon.org/) is a great place to start to learn about all things Aragon. This [blog](https://blog.aragon.one/) is awesome too. There's also a [monthly newsletter](https://monthly.aragon.org/) I guess?

If you want to learn more about the architecture of Aragon in general, the [Wiki](https://wiki.aragon.org/) is probably the best (and the most boring) way to familiarize yourself with Aragon. There are also [user guides](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/), but I don't know of anyone who's actually used them. There's also the dev docs at [hack.aragon](https://hack.aragon.org/). These are excellent, but aimed at a more technical audience.

## The Aragon Client

This is the thing you use to interact with Aragon. It's fairly standard, but takes a little getting used to at first. I highly recommend just going to https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/ to try it out. ([If you have Metamask or Web3 enabled](guides/ethereum.md)) You'll be able to create a DAO and explore the apps. It's not fun exploring a Decentralized Autonomous Commuhnity of 1, but at least you'll learn where the buttons are ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Aragon Apps

The Aragon Core team officially ships and maintains a few apps. It would be cool if someone explained them here or linked to something that did.
