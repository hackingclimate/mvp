1Hive is a community driven project built on Aragon using Autark's TPS apps to create positive-sum incentive mechanisms that are run and enforced by the security of the Ethereum blockchain. If that sounds like gibberish to you, good! This page explains all those concepts in more detail and provides tools and resources you need to get started üèÅ

## [Metamask ü¶ä](https://metamask.io/)

Metamask allows you to use Ethereum based applications in your browser. The [website](https://metamask.io/) has a video showing how it works. The TL;DR: go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), download [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), open it up and follow the instructions. Write down all the passwords and passphrases you use. If you lose them, you'll lose all your tokens and need to start from scratch with another account. This is important. Any problems you have should be directed at the Metamask team as they are more familiar with their product than anyone else.

## [Rinkeby üì•](https://faucet.rinkeby.io)

Rinkeby is a test network for Ethereum. It's free to get tokens and they're not worth anything beyond sentimental value. You cannot exchange them for real ETH or anything else. What happens on Rinkeby stays on Rinkeby. 
We're currently using Rinkeby to test our DAO. You can visit the [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io) to get some free tokens. This usually works, but if you have difficulties or don't have the social media accounts they require, just say hi on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/1hive) in the #general channel and we'll help you out üòä

## [Aragon ü¶Ö](https://aragon.org)

Aragon is a project that wants to empower people and create more freedom in the world. Most people like that idea, but Aragon is actually doing something about it. You can read all about it in [their manifesto](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-0.md). 

### Learning About Aragon 

The [website](https://aragon.org/) is a great place to start to learn about all things Aragon. This [blog](https://blog.aragon.one/) is awesome too. There's also a [monthly newsletter](https://monthly.aragon.org/). 

There's excellent dev docs at [hack.aragon](https://hack.aragon.org/), but they are aimed at a more technical audience.

If you want to learn more about the architecture of Aragon in general, the [Wiki](https://wiki.aragon.org/) is probably the best (and the most boring) way to familiarize yourself with Aragon. There are also [user guides](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/), but I don't know of anyone who's actually used them.

### [Using Aragon](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#0-introduction)

Start with the [Aragon user guide](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#0-introduction).

The client is the thing you use to interact with software. In this case that's [the Aragon app](https://github.com/aragon/aragon) itself. The UI is fairly standard, but takes a some getting used to at first. While you can go to https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/ to roll your own DAO, it's not very fun exploring a decentralized organization of 1. Luckily you don't have to! [1Hive has DAO that's live and running](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211). Feel free to click around and explore how the various apps correspond to the spec outline in the [handbook](https://1hive.github.io/mvp/docs/guides/1hive). Don't worry, unless you're a member of the hive that has voting power you can't break anything, so any button is fair game. 

### [Aragon Apps](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#3-aragon-apps)

The Aragon Core team officially ships and maintains a few apps. Good luck! üçÄ
