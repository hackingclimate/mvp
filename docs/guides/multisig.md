## What is a multi-sig?

A “Token project with Multisig” is an organization where the resources of the organization are controlled by m-of-n members of a multisig contract, where n is 100% of tokenholders and m is the Min.

For example, in a 2-of-2 multisig organization, two signatures from two different specified accounts are required for a proposal to pass.
