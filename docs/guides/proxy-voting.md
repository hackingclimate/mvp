Life is short and I trust you to vote like I would vote

## What is proxy voting?

Proxy voting (aka liquid democracy or delegate voting) is when you transfer your voting power to someone else. You do not lose or give away your voting power as you can take it back at any time. You're really just saying that you trust someone to vote in a way that aligns with your interests and you'll vote however they vote.
