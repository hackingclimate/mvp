## What is a Democracy?

A “Token project with Democracy” is an organization where the vote cast by a tokenholder is weighted proportionally to their ownership stake of tokens minted by the organization. For example, if a tokenholder owns 5% of the tokens minted by the organization then their vote will count as 5% of the total votes on a given proposal.
